<b>Any rules outlined here may be broken where they improve readability.</b>

<h2>Paths and files</h2>
    - Filenames will be fully lowercase If they are comprised of more than one 
      word they will be separated by underscores.
      
    - Folders follow the same rules as filenames but <b>must</b> only be one word.

<h2>Naming:</h2>
    - Class, variable and method names will all be lowercase. If they are 
      comprised of more than one word they will be separated by underscores.
      
    - Namespace names follow the same rules as above but <b>must</b> only be one
      word. Furthermore, they must be as deep as the source file is in the folder
      structure.
