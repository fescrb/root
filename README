Summary:
	The Root Engine will be a small rendering engine with the main aim
	to be completely cross-platform, easy to use and to learn. 

Building from source (only Linux is supported as of now):
 
 Linux:
 
	Dependencies:
		CMake
 
	Optional:
		boost (for unit tests)
 
	If you don't want to pollute the source tree, make a separate folder:
	 
		$ mkdir build; cd build
		
	Then execute:
	 
		$ cmake .. 
		
	Or, if you want to build with unit tests:
	
		$ cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE="Testing"
		
	To use SIMD instructions, use cmake with the following argument:
	
		$ cmake .. -DROOT_USE_SIMD=1
		
	NOTE: All options can be used together.
		
	Then:
	
		$ make
